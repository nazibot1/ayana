A hand build bot for my Discord Server "La Taverne". You can use my code or my bot any usage. I'm creating it for entertainment, and develop my skills in programming.

It's build with Node.js and his extention Discord.js. I'm commentting all my code in English. The only thing in other languages are the content it self.

Fell free to use it and modify it. Please tell me if you're using it for none personnal usage like commercial product(s). I just want to know if it's use for another thing than personnal usage :) (don't want money, don't worry)
